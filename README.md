# Atlar frontend home assignment
Basic demo covering the following day-to-day tasks of a customer working in a finance team:

- *"I log in to each bank every morning to verify that we do not have any account with zero or negative balance"*

- *"I note the account balance for each account into my own excel sheet, then look at the trend of account balances over time to see that we're not trending aggressively downwards"*

- *"I go through our transactions and check that there are no big, potentially fraudulent, pay-outs from our accounts during the past days (above ~10k EUR would be considered suspicious)"*

## Prerequisites & instructions

1. Vite installed.
2. Local environment variables `VITE_ATLAR_API_URL` and `VITE_ATLAR_AUTH` set so that they can be referenced by `import.meta.env.[VARIABLE NAME]`.

    **Example (in .env.local)**

    `VITE_ATLAR_API_URL='https://api.atlar.com/financial-data/v2/'`

    `VITE_ATLAR_AUTH='Basic VVNFk5BTU6k9U00VQQNTV09SRDEyMzQ1='`
    

3. Navigate to root folder of project.
4. Run 'npm run dev' to start development server. Make sure port used is 3000 to avoid CORS issues.

## TODO
- Responsiveness for smaller (e.g. mobile) screens. I limited the project to desktops assuming that most users will access the app at work on their computer.

- Pushing of data to server. Right now the app is read-only, meaning the user can't make any changes to the stored data, only fetch and display it.

- The userÂ should be able to click on e.g. an account listed in the Home view and be taken to a page showing more details. I have done a very simple implementation of this for the payments page.

- Tables showing data should be limited to for example 20 rows and then require some sort of interaction from the user in order to load more.

- Use styling (mostly colors) more consistently in order to make the most relevant information stand out and make interactive elements better communicate that they are interactive to the user.
